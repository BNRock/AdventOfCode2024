## Soln
# Part 1
- import entire word search into 2d array
then loop through each letter:
-make functions for forwards backwards, up, down, diagonal, to test if the next letter is an M then A then S.

# Part 2
- go through each A, then manually check if theres 2 of each letter around the corners, and if the diagnonals dont match
